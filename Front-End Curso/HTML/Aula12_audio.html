    <h2>Slave To The Rhythm - Michael Jackson</h2>

    <p>
    (Verse 1)<br>
    She dances in the sheets at nights<br>
    She dances to his needs<br>
    She dances 'til he feels just right<br>
    Until he falls asleep<br>
    She dances at the crack of dawn<br>
    And quickly cooks his food<br>
    She can't be late, can't take too long<br>
    The kids must get to school<br>
    She's a slave to the rhythm<br>
    She's a slave to the rhythm of
  </p>

  <p>
   (Chorus)<br>
    She's a slave to the rhythm<br>
    She's a slave to the rhythm of<br>
    The rhythm of love, the rhythm of love
  </p>

  <p>
    (Verse 2)<br>
    She dances for the men at work<br>
    Who works her all the time<br>
    She can't be rude and she says so<br>
    "I must be home tonight"<br>
    She dances to the kitchen stove<br>
    Dinner is served by nine<br>
    He says his food's an hour late<br>
    She must be outta her mind<br>
    She's a slave to the rhythm<br>
    She's a slave to the rhythm of
  </p>

  <p>
    (Bridge)<br>
    She works so hard, just to make her way<br>
    For a man who just don't appreciate<br>
    And though he takes her love in vain<br>
    Still she could not stop<br>
    Couldn't break his chains<br>
    She danced through the night in fear of her life<br>
    She danced to a beat of her own<br>
    She let out a cry and swallowed her pride<br>
    She knew she was needed back home<br>
    Home. Ooh
  </p>

   <p>
    (Chorus)<br>
    She's a slave to the rhythm<br>
    She's a slave to the rhythm of<br>
    She's a slave to the rhythm<br>
    She's a slave to the rhythm of<br>
    The rhythm of love, the rhythm of love<br>
    Love, love, love
  </p>
